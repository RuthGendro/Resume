# Online Resume

Online Resume is a resume project built in conjunction with Udacity staff and [Udacity.com's](https://www.udacity.com/) [Front-end nanodegree course](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001). The Udacity project files can be found [here](https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-resume). The online resume displays Ruth Gendro's resume using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and jQuery. View the resume [here](https://ruthgendro.github.io/Resume/).

# Contributions

Udacity provided all of the files with some of the code pre-completed. Ruth Gendro provided all of the JavaScript in the resumeBuilder.js file while Udacity provided all of the code in the index.html and jQuery.js files. The CSS and helper.js files were largely written by Udacity with some tweaks and additions provided by Ruth Gendro.

*Contact information
*Message, which includes the resume's summary statement
*Skills, which includes various programming languages, frameworks, libraries
